A link to demoing the application leveraging Synchronous Commands Over Apache Kafka. The demo application
is using Subscribe approach as mentioned in the presentation. 1 NGINX Load Balancer and 2 Request Handlers.
The Vue application generates the QUIZ_ID (which is used as the key) so NGINX will send requests to both request
handlers, and 1 will say "me" and handle the request and one will say "not me" and return a 406 to the load-balancer
to indicate that it is not the instance that has the partition that the given QUIZ_ID will end up on.
